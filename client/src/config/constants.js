    question: "Do I need to be home while my house is being cleaned?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! One of our many goals at Sabin Cleaning Services is to be a convenience to our customers and not put a halt to their day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my house not smell “clean”?",
    answer: `Sabin Cleaning Services is a 100% green, environmentally friendly cleaning company, meaning all of the products we use are non-toxic, non-abrasive, and essentially odorless. Although we could add a manufactured fragrance to our products, not everyone likes the same scent.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have the same crew member each time?",
    answer:
      "As much as we wish we could guarantee this, it doesn't always work out that way. Our service center managers do what they can to ensure you have a crew member that you feel comfortable with or will be the best match for your home. Ideally, we like to have 2-3 crew members familiar with your home should a particular crew member not be available for your scheduled cleaning for any reason.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I leave a tip?",
    answer:
      "As with any service provided, like going to a restaurant or a hair salon, tipping is encouraged.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many crewmembers are you sending to my house?",
    answer:
      "Typically, we only send one crewmember to a cleaning. This ensures more accountability in the home, and gives our crewmembers more hours! However, sometimes we will send more than one crewmember should it be a larger job.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to leave out cleaning products?",
    answer:
      "We provide and bring all of our own green and eco-friendly cleaning products.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my cleaning plans and rotate rooms?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! We can create and tailor custom cleaning plans that will best fit your unique lifestyle and your home!",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have a pet?",
    answer:
      "We love pets! We are happy to clean your home with your pet(s) there, but we do ask that you put them in a safe place where they will not be in the way of our cleaning crew.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I have lots of collectibles and nic-nacs - How should we handle that?",
    answer:
      "That is up to you. We don't go inside cabinets to dust routinely, but items out in the open will be moved and dusted unless you specify otherwise. Obviously, homes with lots of things to dust take longer than those without, so it will inevitably be reflected in the price of cleaning your home. If you have a particular item or items that you especially cherish and would like to minimize the risk of that item being broken or damaged, we will be happy to note such things and leave them alone. Unfortunately accidents do happen, but let's minimize the risk where you see fit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a better day of the week to be cleaned?",
    answer:
      "The old inclination of “getting it cleaned for the weekend” is now counter-balanced by “It stays cleaner, longer, if I get it done on Monday or Tuesday.” So, you decide. Then, ask for your preference, and we will work with you as much as our schedule and your geography allows us.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have a special request?",
    answer:
      "We are happy to accommodate special requests. Just let us know what you need, and we will do our best to make it happen.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean windows?",
    answer:
      "The routine we offer is inside and out of the front storm door, the back patio door, and inside of the window over the kitchen sink, all weather permitting. Beyond that, you are better off calling a professional window washing company to clean your windows.",
