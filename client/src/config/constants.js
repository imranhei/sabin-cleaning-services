Obviously, homes with lots of things to dust take longer than those without, so it will inevitably be reflected in the price of cleaning your home. If you have a particular item or items that you especially cherish and would like to minimize the risk of that item being broken or damaged, we will be happy to note such things and leave them alone. Unfortunately accidents do happen, but let's minimize the risk where you see fit.",
